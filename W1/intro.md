# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m **Alexandros**, hailing from Athens, where I dive deep into the world of data as a data/analytics engineer.  

Iâ€™ve wrangled data in all shapes and sizesâ€”optimizing workflows, slashing compute costs, uncovering hidden discrepancies, and crafting rock-solid cloud migrations with tools like **Databricks, Azure Synapse, and AWS EMR**.  

### Ask me about:  
- **Spark** (distributed data processing, Databricks)  
- **Data modeling** and **pipeline design**  
- **ETL/ELT workflows** and **cloud migrations**  
- **NLP** and **LLMs**  
-  **Big Data** solutions  


### What Iâ€™m looking for in Data Freelancer:  
1. Develop an **entrepreneurial mindset**  
2. Create more **freedom** in my career and lifestyle  
3. Connect with **like-minded professionals** in the data space  

### Outside of work, youâ€™ll often find me:  
1. Playing the **bouzouki** (a traditional Greek instrument ðŸŽ¶)  
2. Staying active with **exercise** to keep energized and focused  


Letâ€™s connect and make data magic happen! ðŸš€
